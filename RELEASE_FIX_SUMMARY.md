# Release Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem

The GitHub Actions release workflow (`release.yml`) was completing successfully but **not uploading any artifacts** to releases. This meant:
- v0.2.0 release has 0 artifacts
- v0.1.0 release has 0 artifacts
- Only app-v0.0.1 has artifacts (manually added after a failed workflow)

## Root Cause

The workflow used a custom build and upload approach:
1. Built with `npm run tauri build`
2. Used a 200+ line JavaScript script to find and upload artifacts
3. The script had complex logic to search for artifacts in hardcoded paths
4. It was unreliable and prone to failure

## Solution

Replaced the custom approach with the official **`tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0`**:
- This action is maintained by the Tauri team
- It handles both building AND uploading artifacts automatically
- It knows exactly where artifacts are generated
- It's battle-tested and used by many projects

## Changes Made

### 1. `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Simplified by ~200 lines)

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Build Tauri app
  run: npm run tauri build -- ${{ matrix.args }}

- name: Find and upload build artifacts (200+ lines of JavaScript)
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    script: |
      # Complex artifact finding and uploading logic
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Build and upload artifacts using Tauri Action
  uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    releaseId: ${{ needs.create-release.outputs.release_id }}
    args: ${{ matrix.args }}
```

### 2. `.github/workflows/test-release.yml` (New)

Created a test workflow that:
- Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- Builds only for Ubuntu (fastest for testing)
- Verifies artifacts are uploaded
- Includes cleanup instructions

### 3. Documentation

- `docs/release-workflow-testing.md` - Complete testing guide
- `README.md` - Added release process section
- `test-build.sh` - Local build test script

## How to Test

### Quick Test (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Actions â†’ test-release workflow](https://github.com/amanasci/RefForge/actions/workflows/test-release.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter a test tag name: `test-v0.0.1`
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Wait ~10 minutes for completion
6. Check the "verify-artifacts" job output
7. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/amanasci/RefForge/releases) and verify the test release has artifacts

**Cleanup:**
- Delete the test release from the Releases page
- Delete the test tag: `git push origin :refs/tags/test-v0.0.1`

### Full Test (All Platforms)

To test all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows):

```bash
# Create and push a test tag
git tag test-v0.0.2
git push origin test-v0.0.2
```

This will trigger the full workflow (~30 minutes) and you can verify all platform artifacts are uploaded.

## Expected Artifacts

A successful release should include:

| Platform | Artifacts |
|----------|-----------|
| **Linux (ubuntu-22.04)** | `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.rpm` |
| **macOS (Intel)** | `.dmg`, `.app.tar.gz` |
| **macOS (ARM64)** | `.dmg`, `.app.tar.gz` |
| **Windows (x64)** | `.msi`, `-setup.exe` |
| **Windows (ARM64)** | `.msi`, `-setup.exe` |

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Test workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Test workflow uploads artifacts (verify in job output)
- [ ] Test release has artifacts attached
- [ ] Full workflow runs successfully on a test tag
- [ ] All expected artifacts are present in the release
- [ ] Artifacts can be downloaded and installed

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Reliability**: Uses official, well-tested action
2. **Simplicity**: 200+ lines of complex code removed
3. **Maintainability**: Tauri team keeps the action up-to-date
4. **Correctness**: Action knows exactly where artifacts are
5. **Testability**: Easy to test with the new test workflow

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can revert to the previous workflow:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

However, the old workflow had the same issue (no artifacts uploaded), so this would not be recommended.

## Next Release

When creating the next release (e.g., v0.3.0):

1. Update version in `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
2. Commit the changes
3. Create and push a tag: `git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`
4. The workflow will automatically create a release with all artifacts
5. Verify the release has all expected artifacts

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the [testing guide](docs/release-workflow-testing.md)
2. Review the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
3. Check if the `tauri-apps/tauri-action` version is up-to-date
4. Verify the Tauri configuration in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
